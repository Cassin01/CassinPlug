# neoline.vim
An awesome Status Line Plugin for minimarist

# Feature
1. Compatible with every kind of color schemes
2. Simple

## Getting Stated
### Instllation
1. I recommend installing vim-plug and then just add ``Plug 'Cassin01/CassinPlug'`` to your ~/.vimrc
2. and add ``set statusline=2`` to your ~/.vimrc
## Note
### Do not use any plugins that retate with Status Line, when you use this plugin.
Cause conflicts
